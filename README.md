# Data Structures – University Assignments

This repository contains the complete set of assignments and exercises I developed for my **Data Structures** course at Biola University.

## 📚 Course Overview

The course focused on understanding and implementing fundamental data structures and their applications, with emphasis on:

- Time and space complexity analysis
- Efficient algorithm design
- Code readability and modularity

## 🧠 Topics Covered

Throughout the course, I implemented and experimented with (as of now):

- Arrays and Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Structures
- OOP

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a lab or project submitted during the semester

## 🔧 How to Run

Most assignments are written in C++ and can be compiled with:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 filename.cpp -o output && ./output
